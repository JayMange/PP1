Aging Skater --

  Aging skater is a website for older skaters to connect and meetup. It offers a relaxed atmosphere for learning how to skate or helping to pick it back up.

  Users of this site will be able to post pics to the gallery and members can arrange to meetup at various skateparks or to just go for a coffee.

Features --

Navigation Bar -

  Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, Gallery and Sign Up page and is identical in each page to allow   for easy navigation.
  This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.
  
Landing Page --

  The landing page includes an image and text with a short message followed by a login button.
  
About section -
 
  The about section is a short message offering users to join our meetups.

  The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites for Love Running. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user.
  The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media

  This section is valuable to the user as they will be able to easily identify the types of events the organisation puts together.

  The signup page is for new users to sign up to Aging Skate and get them started with skateboarding. The user will be able to specify if they prefer street, vert or both.
  
  
Testing --
  
  I have tested this website on chrome, firefox, edge and brave and all work fine. The website resizes appropriately for all devices. I found one issue when on mobile, the sign up part of the navbar wraps under the home page. Not ideal. 

Validator Testing--

  HTML - No errors were returned after running it through the offical W3C Validator.
  CSS - No errors were returned after running it through the offical (Jigsaw) Validator. 
  Accessibility - I confirmed that the colors and fonts chosen are easy to read and accessible by running it through lighthouse in devtools and getting a score of 92.
  
Unfixed bugs --
  
  Mentioned in the testing the unfixed bug is the sign up button on mobile.

Deployment --

  I deployed the project through github pages.
